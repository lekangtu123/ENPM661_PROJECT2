# ENPM661_PROJECT2
The python code here is to make it easier to view the coordinates of the obstacle map.

How to run the code:
    Copy and paste this code into the folder you are now running in your terminal and type 
    
    "python3 Project2_map.py" 
    

Then you will then be able to use the mouse to visualise the coordinates, which will be displayed in the bottom left corner.
